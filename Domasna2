        <b>Bjelo Dugme</b>
    <ol><b>Bjelo Dugme</b> (trans. White Button) was a Yugoslav rock band, based in Sarajevo. Bijelo Dugme is widely
        considered to have been the most popular band ever to exist in the former Socialist Federal Republic of
        Yugoslavia and one of the most important acts of the Yugoslav rock scene.

        Bijelo Dugme was officially formed in 1974, although the members of the default lineup, guitarist Goran
        Bregović, vocalist Željko Bebek, drummer Ipe Ivandić, keyboardist Vlado Pravdić and bass guitarist Zoran
        Redžić, were previously active under the name Jutro. The band's debut album Kad bi bio bijelo dugme,
        released in 1974, brought them nationwide popularity with its Balkan folk-influenced hard rock sound. The
        band's future several releases, featuring similar sound, maintained their huge popularity, described by the
        media as "Dugmemania", and the band's work, especially their symphonic ballads with poetic lyrics, was also
        widely praised by the critics. In the early 1980s, with the emergence of Yugoslav new wave scene, the band
        moved towards new wave, managing to remain one of the most popular bands in the country. After the
        departure of Bebek in 1983, the band was joined by vocalist Mladen Vojičić "Tifa", with whom the band
        recorded only one, self-titled album. The band's last vocalist, Alen Islamović, joined the band in 1986,
        and with him Bijelo Dugme recorded two albums, disbanding, with the rising tensions in Yugoslavia, in 1989.
        In 2005, the band reunited in the lineup that featured most of the musicians that passed through the band,
        including all three vocalists, for three concerts, in Sarajevo, Bosnia and Herzegovina, in Zagreb, Croatia
        and in Belgrade, Serbia.</ol>

        History

<body>
    <ol><b><h3>The beginnings(1969-73)</h3></b></ol>
    <ol><b><h4>Kodeksi(1961-71)</h4></b></ol>
    <ol>The band's history begins in 1969. At the time, the future leader of Bijelo Dugme, Goran Bregović, was the bass
        guitarist in the band Beštije (trans. The Beasts). He was spotted by Kodeksi (The Codexes) vocalist Željko
        Bebek. As Kodeksi needed a bass guitarist, on Bebek's suggestion, Bregović became a member of the band. The
        band's lineup consisted of Ismeta Dervoz (vocals), Edo Bogeljić (guitar), Željko Bebek (rhythm guitar and
        vocals), Goran Bregović (bass guitar), and Luciano Paganotto (drums). At the time, the band Pro Arte was
        also interested in hiring Bregović, but he decided to stay with Kodeksi. After performing in a night club in
        Dubrovnik, Kodeksi were hired to perform in a club in Naples, Italy. However, the parents of the only female
        member, Ismeta Dervoz, did not allow her to go to Italy. In Naples, the band initially performed covers of
        songs by Cream and the Jimi Hendrix Experience, but were soon asked to perform music more suitable for night
        clubs. After two months, the band's guitarist Edo Bogeljić returned to Sarajevo to continue his studies, and
        Bregović switched to guitar. Local Italian musician called Fernando Savino was brought in to play the
        bass,but after he quit too, Bebek called up old friend Zoran Redžić, formerly of the band Čičak
        (Burdock).Redžić in turn brought along his bandmate from Čičak Milić Vukašinović as replacement on drums
        for Paganotto, who also quit in the meantime. Vukašinović brought new musical influences along the lines of
        what Led Zeppelin and Black Sabbath were doing at the time. Additionally, he convinced Bregović, Bebek and
        Redžić on incorporating the new sound into their set,and within two weeks of his arrival, Kodeksi were
        fired from all the places they were playing.</ol>

    <ol>The foursome of Bebek, Bregović, Redžić and Vukašinović stayed on the island of Capri and in 1970 relocated
        back to Naples. At this time, the other three members persuaded Bebek to stop playing the rhythm guitar
        reasoning that it was not fashionable any more. Bebek also had trouble adapting to the new material vocally.
        He would sing the intro on most songs and then step back as the other three members improvised for the
        remainder of songs, with Vukašinović taking the vocal duties more and more often.After being a key band
        member only several months earlier, Bebek thought his role was gradually being reduced. During the fall of
        1970, he left Kodeksi to return to Sarajevo.</ol>

    <ol>Vukašinović, Bregović, and Redžić continued to perform, but had to return to Sarajevo in the spring of 1971,
        when Bregović's mother and Redžić's brother came to Italy to bring them back. Upon returning, the trio had
        only one concert in Sarajevo, performing under the name Mića, Goran i Zoran (Mića, Goran and Zoran). At the
        concert, they performed covers of songs by Cream, Jimi Hendrix Experience, Led Zeppelin, Black Sabbath, Deep
        Purple, Ten Years After, Taste, Free, and managed to thrill the audience.[4] Soon after, the trio got the
        opportunity to appear in a Television Sarajevo show, but under the condition that they record a song of their
        own. Hastily composed and recorded "Ja i zvezda sjaj" ("Me and the Stars' Glow") was of poor quality and
        little artistic value, which influenced Vukašinović's decision to move to London. He left Sarajevo in
        late summer of 1971, and the trio ended their activity.</ol>

    <ol><b><h3>Jutro(1971-73)</h3></b></ol>

    <ol> At the autumn of 1971, guitarist Ismet Arnautalić invited Bregović to form Jutro (Morning).The band's lineup
        featured, alongside Arnautalić and Bregović, Redžić on bass, Gordan Matrak on drums and vocalist Zlatko Hodnik.
        Bregović wrote his first songs as a member of Jutro.The band had made some recordings with Hodnik when Bregović
        decided they needed a vocalist with more aggressive vocal style, so he invited Bebek to become the band's new
        singer.With Bebek, the band recorded the song "Patim, evo, deset dana" ("I've Been Suffering for Ten Days"),
        which was, in 1972, released as the B-side of the single "Ostajem tebi" ("I Remain Yours"), which was recorded
        with
        Hodnik.After the song recording, Bebek left the band to serve the army, but the rest of the band decided to
        wait for his return to continue their activity.</ol>

    <ol>During Bebek's short leave from the army, the band recorded four more songs: "Kad bi' bio bijelo dugme" ("If I
        Were
        a White Button"), "U subotu, mala" ("On Saturday, Baby"), "Na vrh brda vrba mrda" (the title being a
        traditional
        tongue-twister) and "Hop-cup" ("Whoopsie Daisy"), the first two appearing on a 7" single. Dissatisfied with the
        music direction the band was moving towards, Arnautalić left the band at the end of 1972, convinced that the
        right
        to the name Jutro should belong to him.For some time, guitarist Midorag "Bata" Kostić, a former member of YU
        Grupa, rehearsed with the band, but this cooperation was soon ended.YU Grupa were one of the pioneers in
        combining elements of the traditional music of the Balkans with rock, and Bregović would later state on number
        of
        occasions that this cooperation influenced Bijelo Dugme's folk rock sound. After Matrak left the band, he was
        replaced by Perica Stojanović, who was shortly after replaced by former Pro Arte member Vladimir Borovčanin
        "Šento".Borovčanin tried to secure a record contract with Jugoton, but lost faith in his new band after he
        failed.He and Redžić neglected rehearsals, and both left the band after an argument with Bregović.</ol>

    <ol>Redžić was replaced by Ivica Vinković, who was at the time a regular member of Ambasadori, but was not able to
        travel with the band on their Soviet Union tour. Borovčanin was replaced by former Mobi Dik (Moby Dick) and Rok
        (Rock) member Goran "Ipe" Ivandić Instead of second guitar, Bregović decided to include keyboards in the band's
        new lineup. Experienced Vlado Pravdić, a former member of Ambasadori and Indexi, became Jutro's keyboardist.
        The
        band prepared several songs for the recording in Radio Sarajevo's studio, but Arnautalić pulled his
        connections,
        and Jutro's recording sessions were cancelled. However, the band managed to make an agreement with producer
        Nikola Borota Radovan, who allowed them to secretly record the songs "Top" ("Cannon") and "Ove ću noći naći
        blues"
        ("This Night I'll Find the Blues") in the studio. The intro to "Top" was inspired by traditional ganga
        music.Soon after, Vinković rejoined Ambasadori, and was replaced by Jadranko Stanković, a former member of
        Sekcija (Section) and Rok.</ol>

    <ol> At this time, the band adopted the name Bijelo Dugme. They decided to change the name because of the conflict
        with
        Aranautalić, but also because of the existence of another, Ljubljana-based band with the name Jutro. As the
        band was already known for the song "Kad bi' bio bijelo dugme", they choose the name Bijelo Dugme. The band
        officially started working under this name from January 1974.</ol>
