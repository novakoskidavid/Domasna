    <ol>The <b>Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries <b></b>(OPEC</b>, /ˈoʊpɛk/ OH-pek, or <b>OPEP</b> in
    several other
    languages) is an intergovernmental organization of 15 nations, founded in 1960 in <b>Baghdad</b> by the first five
    members (<b>Iran, Iraq, Kuwait, Saudi Arabia</b>, and <b>Venezuela</b>), and headquartered since 1965 in <b>Vienna,
        Austria</b> .
    As of September 2018, the 15 countries accounted for an estimated 44 percent of <b>global oil production and
        81.5 percent of the world's "proven" oil reserves</b>, giving OPEC a major influence on <b>global oil prices</b>
    that
    were previously determined by the American-dominated so called as <b>"Seven Sisters”</b> grouping of multinational
    oil companies.</ol>

    <ol>The stated mission of the organization is to "coordinate and unify the petroleum policies of its member
    countries and ensure the stabilization of oil markets, in order to secure an efficient, economic and
    regular supply of petroleum to consumers, a steady income to producers, and a fair return on capital for
    those investing in the petroleum industry."[4] The organization is also a significant provider of
    information about the international oil market. The current OPEC members are: <b>Algeria, Angola, Ecuador,
        Equatorial Guinea, Gabon, Iran, Iraq, Kuwait, Libya, Nigeria, Qatar</b>, the <b>Republic of the Congo, Saudi
        Arabia </b>(the <b>de facto</b> leader), <b>United Arab Emirates</b>, and <b>Venezuela</b>. <b>Indonesia</b> is
    a former member. By
    continent, two are South American, seven African, and six are Asian (Middle East). Two-thirds of OPEC's oil
    production and reserves are in its six <b>Middle-Eastern</b> countries that surround the oil-rich <b>Persian Gulf</b>.</ol>

    <ol>The formation of OPEC marked a turning point toward national sovereignty over natural resources, and OPEC
    decisions have come to play a prominent role in the global oil market and international relations. The
    effect can be particularly strong when wars or civil disorders lead to extended interruptions in supply. In
    the 1970s, restrictions in oil production led to a dramatic rise in oil prices and in the revenue and
    wealth of OPEC, with long-lasting and far-reaching consequences for the global economy. In the 1980s, OPEC
    began setting production targets for its member nations; generally, when the targets are reduced, oil
    prices increase. This has occurred most recently from the organization's 2008 and 2016 decisions to trim
    oversupply.</ol>

    <ol>Economists often cite OPEC as a textbook example of a cartel that cooperates to reduce market competition,
    but one whose consultations are protected by the doctrine of state immunity under international law. In
    December 2014, "OPEC and the oil men" ranked as #3 on Lloyd's list of "the top 100 most influential people
    in the shipping industry".[5] However, the influence of OPEC on international trade is periodically
    challenged by the expansion of non-OPEC energy sources, and by the recurring temptation for individual OPEC
    countries to exceed production targets and pursue conflicting self-interests.</b></ol>

        <ol>Current member countries</ol>
    </b></body>
<ol>As of June 2018, OPEC has 15 member countries: six in the <b>Middle East (Western Asia)</b>, seven in <b>Africa</b>, and two in
    <b>South America</b>. According to the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA), OPEC's combined rate of oil
    production (including gas condensate) represented 44 percent of the world's total in 2016, and OPEC accounted
    for 81.5 percent of the world's "proven" oil reserves, including 48 percent from just the six Middle Eastern
    members:</ol>

    <ol>Approval of a new member country requires agreement by three-quarters of OPEC's existing members(includes founding
    members also), including all five of the founders. In October 2015, Sudan formally submitted an application to
    join, but it is not yet a member.</ol>
